# Operating-System
Optimized File System using File Allocation Tables - Built dynamic File System which tracked allocated and free space on disk, maintained directories and le names and tracking where each le is physically stored on the disk under the  course Operating Systems. I and my lab partner wrote the whole code in Java implementing different functions as needed by the File System.
