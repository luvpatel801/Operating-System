# Operating-System

Optimized File System using File Allocation Tables 

Built dynamic File System which tracked allocated and free space on disk, maintained directories and file names and tracking where each ÔÄÅfile is physically stored on the disk under the course Operating Systems. I and my lab partner wrote the whole code in Java implementing different functions as needed by the File System.
